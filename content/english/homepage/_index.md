    content: "Many Chinese companies dream about successfully expanding their business overseas, particularly in established markets such as Europe and the United States. However, statistics tell us that more than 50% of all new companies accessing the European market, fail. This is mainly because conquering overseas markets brings many challenges; challenges that your company will not have to deal with while operating domestically.

Developing business in Europe has many benefits: prestige, relatively low taxes, economic stability and an overall healthy business climate to expand your business. However, you shouldn’t underestimate the challenges that you might face. Cross Border China (CBC) can help you to overcome these challenges and accompany you during your (first) steps in Europe, starting from the Netherlands.

CBC can help you with:

    image: "/images/service-2.png"
    content: "The Netherlands is a located in western Europe and has recently become more popular amongst Chinese enterprises developing business in Europe. One of the reasons for this is that the Netherlands is centrally located in Europe and offers fast trade routes to other European countries via air, sea and land. With about 500 million tons of transshipment in 2022, the Rotterdam harbor is the most important international trade hub outside of Asia."

  - title: "Getting started: setting up an overseas branch"
    image: "/images/service-2.png"
    content: "Setting up an overseas branch in the Netherlands is no walk in the park. Like in any other place, there are various rules to follow. Most likely you plan to set up a limited liability company (‘B.V.’ in Dutch), a legal entity that is equivalent to the private limited company. Setting up a B.V. encompasses more than just registering the company at the local chamber of commerce (‘KvK’). You will have to draw up statutes, make a deposit at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, register your company at a notary’s office, and so on.

CBC can help you planning your business and making your first steps on European soil.

When selling products on the European market, a basic understanding of local product & consumer laws is crucial.

Because of its extensive legal experience, CBC can help you to avoid future trouble.
